# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) & Computer Vision
This folder showcases projects dedicated to image processing and the development of deep learning models capable of "seeing" and interpreting visual data.

### -- Project Overview --  
- Design and training of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification and pattern recognition.
- Implementation of end-to-end Computer Vision pipelines, from raw image preprocessing to model deployment.
- Use of specialized tools for visual data exploration and performance monitoring during training.

### -- Key Skills Demonstrated --
- Deep Learning: Architecture design including convolutional, pooling, and dropout layers.
- Image Processing: Handling spatial data, normalization, and augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.
- Model Evaluation: Visualizing training metrics (accuracy/loss) and interpreting confusion matrices for high-precision vision tasks.
